The Nagios [nrpe](https://www.nagios.org/downloads/nagios-core-addons/) package that is included with Debian is old 
and compiled without remote commands execution support.

Yes, I know, it might not be the safest feature around but I use it in some places so I need it.

This script builds nrpe.

Tested on Debian Jessie on ARM
